Warren had previously been a three-term governor of the state of California and in 1948 he had been the republican candidate for vice president. Earl Warren was involved in several of the Supreme Court's most important decisions on subjects like civil rights, most notably the decision that made segregation in public schools unconstitutional. He was also the head of the committee that investigated the assassination of President Kennedy. Warren remained Chief Justice of the US Supreme Court until he retired in 1969.

<strong> More Information for Cambodia's Independence. </strong><br>

Cambodia declares its independence from France during November . King Sihanouk, having previously pushed for independence, took over as the country's leader. Starting in 1946, Cambodian resistance fighters had launched armed attacks against French occupation in a push for independence. Cambodia had been under French-colonial rule for ninety years prior to its independence. After achieving independence the country remained the Kingdom of Cambodia until 1970 when Norodom Sihanouk was overthrown in a United States backed military coup.

Queen Elizabeth II's coronation took place <small><a href="http://www.thepeoplehistory.com/june2nd.html">June 2nd</a> </small>   in the United Kingdom. The coronation was held at Westminster Abbey where thousands of guests gathered to witness the historical event. Elizabeth's father King George VI had passed away during February of the previous year, and not long after his death Elizabeth began her duties as a monarch. She was not formally crowned until the coronation as it was tradition to allow several months to pass for mourning of the previous monarch. It was the first coronation service to be broadcast on television.

<ul>
<li> James D. Watson and Francis H.C. Crick announce discovery of the double-helix structure of DNA. </li></ul>
<strong> More Information for the discovery of the Double Helix. </strong><br>

British physicist Francis Crick and American biologist James Watson discover the double-helix structure of human DNA in February . DNA had been studied since the mid-1800s, but they were the first to figure out that DNA was formed as a double helix, a ladder-like shape, that split up to replicate, unlocking how the passing on of genes worked. At about the same time scientists Rosalind Franklin and Maurice Wilkins were using x-rays to study DNA and were able to provided proof of the double helix structure in one of their images. Watson and Crick published their finding in April of that year. In <a href="http://www.thepeoplehistory.com/1962.html">1962</a>  Crick, Watson and Wilkins were awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology (Franklin had died several years earlier of cancer).
